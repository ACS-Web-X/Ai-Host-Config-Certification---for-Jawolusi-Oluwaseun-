# Ai-Host-Config-For-A-Base_URL
My name is Jawolusi Oluwaseun, I am a Marathon Chess Player (#100Blitz). My Chess Skills have just been converted to an ICT Infrastructure, that is, the Ai-Host. 
Consequently, I can now store/process infoData for personal and commercial purposes; my x-DBMS can now interact with my x-Server and my x-Internet for some Chesscrypted informational exchanges.
